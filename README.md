# LAMBDA-interpreter
a LAMDBA-interpreter written in Java

There are many outputs for watching ?almost every? (at least a lot) steps of it`s move but still not that clear
I even tried to explain it by writing so many annotations

one another edition: I add a HUI and now it can have a better UE

BUT most importantly, it`s a coures PJ after all, so the target (now at least) is to pass the OJ,  233
So It might have a plenty of mistakes in it, anyway, it passed the OJ well and can pass a little number of other tests(designed by me).
